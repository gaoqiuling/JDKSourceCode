/**
 * An {@link Executor} that provides methods to manage termination and
 * methods that can produce a {@link Future} for tracking progress of
 * one or more asynchronous tasks.
 *
 * <p>An {@code ExecutorService} can be shut down, which will cause
 * it to reject new tasks.  Two different methods are provided for
 * shutting down an {@code ExecutorService}. The {@link #shutdown}
 * method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before
 * terminating, while the {@link #shutdownNow} method prevents waiting
 * tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks.
 * Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively executing, no
 * tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted.  An
 * unused {@code ExecutorService} should be shut down to allow
 * reclamation of its resources.
 *
 * <p>Method {@code submit} extends base method {@link
 * Executor#execute(Runnable)} by creating and returning a {@link Future}
 * that can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion.
 * Methods {@code invokeAny} and {@code invokeAll} perform the most
 * commonly useful forms of bulk execution, executing a collection of
 * tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to
 * complete. (Class {@link ExecutorCompletionService} can be used to
 * write customized variants of these methods.)
 *
 * <p>The {@link Executors} class provides factory methods for the
 * executor services provided in this package.
 *
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 *
 * Here is a sketch of a network service in which threads in a thread
 * pool service incoming requests. It uses the preconfigured {@link
 * Executors#newFixedThreadPool} factory method:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class NetworkService implements Runnable {
 *   private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
 *   private final ExecutorService pool;
 *
 *   public NetworkService(int port, int poolSize)
 *       throws IOException {
 *     serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
 *     pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
 *   }
 *
 *   public void run() { // run the service
 *     try {
 *       for (;;) {
 *         pool.execute(new Handler(serverSocket.accept()));
 *       }
 *     } catch (IOException ex) {
 *       pool.shutdown();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * class Handler implements Runnable {
 *   private final Socket socket;
 *   Handler(Socket socket) { this.socket = socket; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     // read and service request on socket
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * The following method shuts down an {@code ExecutorService} in two phases,
 * first by calling {@code shutdown} to reject incoming tasks, and then
 * calling {@code shutdownNow}, if necessary, to cancel any lingering tasks:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * void shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService pool) {
 *   pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted
 *   try {
 *     // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate
 *     if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
 *       pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks
 *       // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled
 *       if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
 *           System.err.println("Pool did not terminate");
 *     }
 *   } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
 *     // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted
 *     pool.shutdownNow();
 *     // Preserve interrupt status
 *     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to the
 * submission of a {@code Runnable} or {@code Callable} task to an
 * {@code ExecutorService}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * any actions taken by that task, which in turn <i>happen-before</i> the
 * result is retrieved via {@code Future.get()}.
